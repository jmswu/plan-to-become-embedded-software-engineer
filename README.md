# Background
I have been working as an electronic engineer for almost 6 years doing hardware and firmware development. This is my plan to improve embedded software development skills.

# The plan
- ~~learn git~~
- Learn embedded Linux system, this should be ongoing.
- Learn yocto to build embedded Linux system
- ~~Python for writing test script/automatic testing~~
- Do an online course (Maybe, only if interested)
   - online course enrolled
     - ~~python~~
     - yocto
     - qt
     - ~~c++ (advanced), maybe do C++ with unreal engine just for fun~~
     - need to find a better C++ advance course (the one above is very basic)
- Learn CI/CD
- Debug with GDB and kernal logging
- Learn SQL/SQLite
- Learn bash script (enough to automatic daily task)

### Advance topics
- data structure and algorithm
- Common Sense Guid to Data Structures and Algorithms: https://amzn.to/2l8ssE6

# Curently learning
- learning Linux with Linux mint
- learning embedded Linux
